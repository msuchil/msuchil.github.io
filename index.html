            Hello! My name is Maria and I'm currently working as an IT Professional.
            I am still not sure which route of expertise I am interested in specializing, but I am having so much fun
            learning. In my free time I enjoy playing video games, crotcheting, and watching anime.
            Anime was suppose to help me learn Japanese, but instead I find myself too into the plot.
            Traveling is definitely on my bucket list - Antarctica being my #1. I do not know why I want to go to such
            a cold climate when I hate the cold but that is ok. I also want to try
            skydiving and going on a hot air balloon ride despite being afraid of heights.
        </p>
